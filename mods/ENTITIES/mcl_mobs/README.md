# MineClone2 Mobs

This is a merged version of Mobs redo MineClone2 Edition (API) and mobs_mc (Mobs content).
The API was rewritten by jordan4ibanez and later Fleckenstein from Mobs redo MineClone2 Edition and merged with mobs_mc by Fleckenstein.
Mobs redo MineClone2 Edition was built by Wuzzy2 and contributors from Mobs Redo. Mobs redo was built by TenPlus1 from Simple Mobs by PilzAdam and mobs_mc was built by maikerumine.

Seems like we've come a long way since 2012.
