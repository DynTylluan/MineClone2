A bamboo button is a redstone component made out of stone which can be pushed to provide redstone power. When pushed, it powers adjacent redstone components for 1 second.=

A wooden pressure plate is a redstone component which supplies its surrounding blocks with redstone power while any movable object (including dropped items, players and mobs) rests on top of it.=
