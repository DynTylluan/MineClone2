A fork of: YOLO - You Only Live Once by sofar
Heavily modified by MysticTempest for MineClone2

A simple player-based hardcore mod.

Players will only have one life in hardcore mode, after dying they will be placed into spectator mode.
As spectators, they will be be: unable to interact with the world, immortal, invisible, have noclip and fly, and health/hunger hudbars will be hidden.


Enabling:  
Enabled via a "Settings" option; newly created worlds will be set to Hardcore Mode. 

Extra Note:  
You only need to toggle it on when creating a hardcore world. 

After doing so; you may 'disable' it again to create non-hardcore worlds.
Hardcore mode for that world will persist after world creation, and across any "Settings" change.
